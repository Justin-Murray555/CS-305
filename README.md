# CS-305


    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
This project was created for Artemis Financial which is a finanical savings and planning institute for their customers. They were looking to increase the security of their system to prevent any attacks on financials or information.
    
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
This project gave me the opportunity to look into common security issues and flaws that were even in my whole coding and gained a deeper understadning of what was causing the flaw. The security of their system is integral to the whole system, if anything happens and a hacker gets into their systems it could damage their reputation heavily
    
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Using the Maven dependency check tool was the biggest help to learning about these secruity issues in the code. I feel like it had a little learning curve but once i understood how to get it to run it was repeatably.
    
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Most important was to start by updating all the current software and then running a depencency check and in the future some penetration testing should be added. 
    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  
While refactoring the code and after i would make sure to debug and run application and check depencency for any new vunerabilities introduced. 
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The owasp site as well as all pdfs/resources provided by the instructor
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

    My abilities to check systems for vunerabilites issues and able approipate fixes to the system.
